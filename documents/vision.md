# Product Vision

### Problem statement:

Current popular social medias are too open to feel meaningful. Keeping up with your friends feels less personal and immediate through these platforms than many would like.

### Target Audience:

Our product is designed for individuals who value direct interaction and people who wish to keep contact with friends through a more private and isolated environment but in a social media type of way.

### Value Proposition:

We aim to create a platform that fosters genuine, spontaneous interactions by allowing users to engage in real-time conversations without the additional presence of strangers. Our product will enable users to connect with friends and family in a more natural and fluid manner, creating an enhanced social-media experience.

### Key Features:

1. **Post on a feed with your friends**
2. **Friends system with suggestions**
3. **Profile**
