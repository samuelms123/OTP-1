## Tech-stack
### Front-end:
* Java
* JavaFX
* Scene Builder
### Backend:
* MariaDb
* ORM/Jakarta Persistence API
* Java
* JWT and Bcrypt for authentication
* Docker
### Testing:
* Jenkins
* JUnit (integration- and unit testing)

Java FX is used for the front-end. The backend is powered by MariaDB for data storage, with ORM/Jakarta Persistence API for database interactions. JAAS Authentication is implemented for secure user authentication. Java was chosen for front- and backend to have a more unified tech stack which will make testing more streamlined.
