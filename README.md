Software Engineering Project 1

## Tech-stack:
### Front-end:
* Java
* JavaFX
### Backend:
* MariaDb
* ORM/Jakarta Persistence API
* Java
* JAAS Authentication

Java FX is used for the front-end. The backend is powered by MariaDB for data storage, with ORM/Jakarta Persistence API for database interactions. JAAS Authentication is implemented for secure user authentication. Java was chosen for front- and backend to have a more unified tech stack which will make testing more streamlined.
